POST /ai/api/cover-analysis/
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Parameters:
- image: Image file
- extract_text: Boolean (default: true)
- analyze_genre: Boolean (default: true)
- save_results: Boolean (default: false)
```

### Batch Categorization API

```

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid image formats
- Network connectivity issues
- API rate limiting
- Processing timeouts
- Database errors

## Performance Optimization

- **Image Caching**: Processed images are cached for faster re-analysis
- **Batch Processing**: Optimized for handling multiple images efficiently
- **Background Tasks**: Long-running analyses run asynchronously
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of temporary files

## Security Considerations

- **File Validation**: Strict validation of uploaded image files
- **Size Limits**: Maximum file size restrictions
- **Access Control**: User authentication required for all features
- **Data Privacy**: Images are processed locally when possible

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"EasyOCR not available" Warning**:
   - This is optional; the system works without EasyOCR
   - Install with: `pip install easyocr` for enhanced OCR

2. **"Gemini API key not configured" Warning**:
   - Add your API key to the `.env` file
   - Restart the Django server after configuration

3. **Low Analysis Accuracy**:
   - Ensure good image quality (high resolution, clear text)
   - Check lighting conditions in images
   - Verify the book cover is fully visible

### Performance Issues

- **Slow Processing**: Check internet connection for Gemini API calls
- **Memory Usage**: Large batch operations may require more RAM
- **Storage Space**: Regular cleanup of processed images recommended

## Future Enhancements
